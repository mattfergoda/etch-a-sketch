# etch-a-sketch  
Uses a CSS-grid and javascript event listeners to allow the user to draw simple sketches. Any time the mouse enters a square on the grid, the color of that square is filled in. The user can clear the grid and resize the square count within the grid. They can also toggle between drawing in color and black. When drawing in color, each drawn square is assigned a random color. If passed over again, the square becomes more dark until it is black. The user can toggle between drawing in black and in color during the same drawing.

## Potential improvements
* Option to export the drawing.
